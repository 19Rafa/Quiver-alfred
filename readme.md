## Usage

1. Type <kbd>qset</kbd> to set your quiver library location. `Quiver-Alfred` constructs a database of your notes to make querying as fast as possible. The database should refresh once every hour and should only take a few seconds to create.

2. Type <kbd>q</kbd> to use! You can search tags by hitting <kbd>q #</kbd>. 

*I can't figure out how to add a favorites section because it doesn't appear to be contained within the library currently.
